## Odroid C1
=======

###### What is this?

I bought a beefy Odroid C1 to tinker and needed a place to store my development work and progress! This repo shall serve as a collection of useful tool and scripts that allows you to learn more about the C1 and do cool stuff.

There's also a casing built to protect it from the hands of others as well as mechanical damage. Also, Adafruit has a super sleek casing design that you can build with some acrylic pieces and laser machine so why not?!
