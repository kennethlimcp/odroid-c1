###### Possible enhancements for V1.1 casing design

- Support the placement/removal of eMMC module
- Adjust the opening for Power/OTG/HDMI
- Open a wider vertical slot to fully expose the IR receiver
- Do a transition fit adjustment to that the board doesn't rotate about the centre in the casing
- Open a slot on the top piece to support the addition of a mini cooling fan
